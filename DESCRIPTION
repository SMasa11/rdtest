Description: This package offers a simultaneous implementation of two major 
  diagnostic tests, the density test and balance test for regression 
  discontinuity (RD) designs. Running these tests separately result in the 
  multiple testing problem that causes a serious over-rejection of the null 
  hypothesis for justifying a RD design. Our joint test resolve the multiple 
  testing problem.
